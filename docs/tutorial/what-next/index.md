Although we're done with our workshop, there's still a LOT more to learn about containers!
We're not going to go deep-dive here, but here are a few other areas to look at next!

## Container Orchestration

Running containers in production is not so hard, but you can't just use `docker-compose` in production.
How do you scale across several machines? Container orchestration solves this problem. 
You sould just learn yourself some Kubernetes, for great good!

## Cloud Native Computing Foundation Projects

The CNCF is a vendor-neutral home for various open-source projects, including Kubernetes, Prometheus, 
Envoy, Linkerd, NATS, and more! You can view the [graduated and incubated projects here](https://www.cncf.io/projects/)
and the entire [CNCF Landscape here](https://landscape.cncf.io/). There are a LOT of projects to help
solve problems around monitoring, logging, security, image registries, messaging, and more!

So, if you're new to the container landscape and cloud-native application development, welcome! Please
connect to the community, ask questions, and keep learning! We're excited to have you!
